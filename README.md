# FitHub

The objective of our project is to develop an Android-based social fitness application called FitHub. The main goals of this application are to increase peopleâ€™s fitness engagement and help them connect with others productively while stuck at home. Our application allows users to create challenges, upload a picture as proof of completion, and challenge others to do the same. Users can motivate each other and hold each other accountable. They will also be able to compare with others how many challenges they have completed to inspire friendly competition. This is needed especially during the ongoing pandemic where we are encouraged to stay home.  Our app can be a fun fitness solution to fight against the negative effects of COVID-19.


Key Technologies Used
Front-end: Android Studio (Java, XML)
For the development of our front-end user interface, we primarily used XML as a way of demonstrating the functionality of FitHub.

Back-end: Firebase NoSQL
The back-end implementation was founded on a Firebase NoSQL database. We chose Firebase because of its ability to be easily integrated into Android Studio and its ability to scale our application. 
Image classification/verification: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook
Python, along with TensorFlow and Keras libraries, were used to classify images as fitness or non-fitness. The image dataset was scraped from Google using Python.
